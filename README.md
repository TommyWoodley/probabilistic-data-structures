# Probabilistic Data Structures for Java

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

Probabilistic Data Structures for Java is a repository that provides a collection of popular probabilistic data structures implemented in the Java programming language. These data structures offer efficient and approximate solutions to various data-related problems with probabilistic guarantees. They are particularly useful when dealing with massive datasets and high-velocity streams, as they can handle large amounts of data while maintaining low memory usage.

The repository aims to be a valuable resource for data engineers, data scientists, and Java developers interested in exploring and using probabilistic data structures in their applications.

## Usage

To use the probabilistic data structures in your Java projects, you can add the relevant package as a dependency to your Maven project.

### Maven Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

TODO

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to use the Java files directly, you can download the entire package and include it in your project.

## List of Data Structures

The repository includes the following probabilistic data structures:

1. Bloom Filter
2. Stable Bloom Filter
3. Scalable Bloom Filter
4. Counting Bloom Filter
5. Count-Min Sketch
6. Cuckoo Filter
7. Deletable Bloom Filter
8. HyperLogLog
9. Inverse Bloom Filter
10. MinHash
11. Partitioned Bloom Filter
12. Scalable Bloom Filter 
13. Top-K

Each data structure is implemented within the `com.tommywoodley.probabilisticdatastructures` package with a focus on efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use. Refer to the individual class files for more details on each data structure.
